# Binary-Addition-8bit
A simple program to add binary digits together from 0-255, and outputs the correct answer in binary format.
THE PROGRAM INPUT GOES AS THE FIRST TO THE EIGHTH DIGIT
IT WILL OUTPUT ALL BINARY DIGITS ON SEPERATE LINES!
Using negative numbers will break the program, and additions which results exceed 255 may not output correctly.
